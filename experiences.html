  Successful DevOps Engineer with Over 6 years of professional Experience dedicated to Cloud, DevOps automation and Cloud Infra structure (cost optimization, governance). I enjoy Designing, Implementing, and Supporting applications in the AWS, GCP cloud infrastructure. I’m a highly motivated, productive team player looking to lead by example. Enthusiastic about exploring new services in the DevOps area. My greatest strength is my ability to thoroughly research a requirement and design a solution that is cost‑effective, resilient, fault‑tolerant, and highly available. Using my cloud expertise, I have greatly contributed to multiple successful migrations to AWS from on‑premise infrastructure
